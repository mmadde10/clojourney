# clojourney

I wanna be the very best
Like no one ever was
To catch them is my real test
To train them is my cause

I will travel across the land
Coding far and wide
Learn Clojure to understand
The power that's inside

(Clojure, gotta code 'em all) It's you and me
I know it's my destiny
(Clojure) Oh, you're my best language
In a world we must defend

(Clojure, gotta code 'em all) A heart so true
Our courage will pull us through

You teach me and I'll teach you
CLOJURE! (gotta code 'em all) gotta code 'em all
